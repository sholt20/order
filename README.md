## A discord clone, but light theme is the only choice.
###### *I know, its gross*

### Info

This parody app of Discord is simplified heavily, but does incorporate websockets (using SocketIO) on an express backend. There are servers with channels, each of
which has its own messages. On loading a channel, the 50 most recent posts to that channel will be displayed. The front end is build on React and Redux, with
vanilla css for styling.
